# Kepler444
Scripts and input files for data-processing for Kepler-444 paper. The repository does not include large input files, and output from fitting with BASTA. A version of the repository including this will be available soon, or can be requested from the author.

Generally, the content of folders is as follows:
- all_combinations: Folder for generating and containing BASTA fits for this study.
- input: Input to be read when fitting (stellar models, observed Kepler-444 parameters).
- modelling: Folder for best-fit, for section 4 of the paper.
- plotting: For generating (almost) all other figures for the paper.
- stats: Scripts for statistical comparisons of fits.
